# Reminder-app

I have developed a MERN stack application with a WhatsApp reminder notification feature. The frontend of the application is built using React.js, while the backend utilizes Node.js and Express.js. The data is stored in a NoSQL database, MongoDB.
The application includes a feature to send reminders via WhatsApp. This was achieved by integrating a WhatsApp API or utilizing a third-party service specifically designed for sending notifications. Depending on the application's needs, reminders can be sent at specified times or triggered by specific events within the application.
In summary, I have successfully developed a MERN stack application that incorporates a WhatsApp reminder notification feature. React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB work together harmoniously to create a powerful and efficient application stack.
